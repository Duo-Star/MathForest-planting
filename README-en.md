## Deep Dive

It is the driver library used by Forest, the codename for the previous machine [153] valley in our world—Nature. Let mathematical rationality dominate cognition.

- Algebra 🦘

Extends a wide range of mathematical functions and provides complex numbers and equation solvers.

- Geometry 🐒

Join hands with N-46V-gmk to step into the geometry hall. We have focused on writing a powerful geometry library centered around vector calculations. Geometric objects can operate in a 3D environment, with a complete API provided for property calculations and object interactions. Personally use `Plane` and `Cone` to derive a `Conic`, experience Pascal's theorem, master poles and polar lines. The built-in `Monxiv` canvas offers a zero-distance dynamic demonstration of geometric transformations.

- Statistics 🐳

Evaluate single-column data and paired data, create distributions, and generate random numbers according to distributions.

- Physics ⛰️

Solve classical physics processes using Euler's method and experience a god's-eye view.
